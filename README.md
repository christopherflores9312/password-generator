# Password Generator

This is a simple password generator web app that allows the user to generate a new, secure password by selecting various criteria. The app was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage

To use the password generator, simply click the "Generate Password" button. This will prompt you to select the length of the password (between 8 and 128 characters) and which types of characters to include (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters). You must select at least one type of character to include in the password.

Once you have selected your criteria, the app will generate a random password that meets your specifications and display it in the text area below the button.

You can copy the generated password to your clipboard by clicking the "Copy to Clipboard" button. This will copy the password to your clipboard and display a message indicating that the password has been copied.
